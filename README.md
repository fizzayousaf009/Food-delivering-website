# Food Delivering Website  

This is my practice project to enhance my HTML and CSS skills by creating a simple, responsive website for a food delivery service. It features sections like Home, Services, About Us, and Contact Us, with a clean design optimized for different devices. To view the website, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
